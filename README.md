# Battleship

Final project for CMSC 21

## Compiling

Type
```
make
```
into your console. This creates a `main` binary inside `bin/` and `.o` files inside `obj/`.

You can then run the binary with
```
bin/main
```

## Cleaning Compiled Files

To remove the compiled files, type
```
make clean
```
Sometimes things (usually font loading) result in segfaults. Try using this and recompiling before moving on.

## TODO

- [ ] Clean up Button.h
- [ ] Figure out how to call functions using the buttons
