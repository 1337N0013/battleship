# Battleship

Final project for CMSC 21

## Compiling

Type

```
make
```

into your console. This creates a `main` binary inside `bin/` and `.o` files inside 'obj/'.

To remove the compiled files, type

```
make clean
```

Sometimes things result in segfaults. Try using this and recompiling before moving on.

## TODO

* Clean up Button.h
* Figure out how to call functions using the buttons
